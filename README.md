### Chrome

 * Change the `Destination` to `Save as PDF`.
 * Make sure the `Paper size` is set to the one defined in your CSS.
 * From the `Margins` list, choose `None` to prevent the browser from overriding our CSS.
 * In the `Options` section, uncheck `Headers and footers` and check `Background colors and images`.
